This repository contains all the spectroscopy data and code devoted to processing it. 

The only module you actually need is spectroscopymain.py. The script Spectrum_Processing_Example.py gives an example of how to use all the main functions you need.

Peak finding is done through a combination of automatic detection and GUI-based manual selection. The grouping of the peaks into lines is also GUI-based.



There are two basic formats in which I'd like to be able to plot 2D spectra. One is large format: axis labels, widths appropriate for the whole page. The other is small format: no axis labels, 1/2 size in both dimensions.
